## Introduction
Today, military international medical missions are commonplace.
In multinational military medical contexts, the ability to swiftly and precisely identify and prescribe pharmaceuticals is paramount. 
Ð•he multinational nature of military operations introduces complexities related to varying drug regulations, formularies, and cultural considerations, further emphasizing the need for standardized and efficient pharmaceutical practices.
Thus, during the mission in other countries, medical doctors are not always able to use the drugs they are used to, and there is a need to use the drugs of the host country.
In addition, in critical situations, doctors from different countries should exchange their available medicines that are used in their country. And the question of quickly finding analogues between doctors from different countries is critically important, because it can save the life of a serviceman.
To solve the task, it is proposed to develop a mobile cross-platform application, with the possibility of working without a network in the conditions of hostilities, which would allow doctors to search for the most accurate analogues of drugs known to them in other countries.
